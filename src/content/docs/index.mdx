### Why Grains.js?

##### Island-based local states (Grains)
1. Each element with `g-state` is a grain of state—completely independent from other HTML elements.
2. Grains.js encourages multiple, decentralized pockets of state, so you can keep concerns neatly separated.
##### Minimal directives, expanding possibilities
    1. Grains.js ships with a small set of core directives—like `g-state`, `g-text`, `g-click`—and is being expanded to include others, such as `g-if` for conditional rendering.
    2. By incrementally introducing just enough directives, you can keep your HTML expressive and reactive without adopting a full-blown framework syntax.
##### Zero build process, pure script
    1. You only need a `<script src="grains.js">` tag to get started. No bundlers, no transpilers, no Node.js-based project setup required. It’s easy to drop into existing server-rendered pages or static sites for an instant boost of interactivity.
##### Mutable or immutable state (with Undo/Redo)
    1. Grains.js can mutate state in place for performance, or operate in immutable mode to enable advanced debugging and time-travel features (i.e., `undo()` and `redo()`). You choose the best approach for each grain of state.
##### Async-friendly
    1. Because Grains.js calls named functions (e.g., `g-click="fetchData"`) rather than forcing inline expressions, you can easily incorporate async calls, data fetching, or other complex logic in pure JavaScript—cleanly separated from your HTML.

In short, Grains.js delivers a lightweight, island-based reactive approach—no global store, no build setup, and a growing set of directives that let you sprinkle declarative UI logic throughout your pages. It’s a natural choice if you need _just enough_ reactivity to stay productive, without the overhead of a full framework.
